## Project Brief

the goal for this project was to design and implement a fitness tracker prototype for a TIVA microcontroller with an attached Orbit BoosterPack peripheral board. Some of the main features were:

- It should estimate the number of steps the user has taken using the accelerometer data
- The number of steps should be used to calculate distance in kilometres and miles
- Pushing the left and right buttons should switch between distance and step view on the display
- Step count and distance should be able to be reset independently by long holding the down button
- Switching one of the switches should cause the program to enter a test mode where the accelerometer data is ignored, and the steps/distance is controlled by pushing the up and down buttons.

In addition to the source code, a copy of the final report for the project is in this repo.
